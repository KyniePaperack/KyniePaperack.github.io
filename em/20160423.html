        <h1 id="title">Dearest Di,</h1>
        <p>I finally have the time, motivation, and effort to write to you, which, to some degree is a rather rare occurrence. Well, at least as far as I know. It has been terribly, terribly long since I last sent you a proper e-mail, but letters, to be honest, are hard to write and they have been getting increasingly hard to write. I haven't much practice with it recently.</p>
        <p>How doth thee fare? Well, I'd hope. You are not sick anymore, yea? Or am I wrong with that? I'm...<em>okay</em>, but it's not really the case you'd make, all things considered. The house has been going a long nicely, but I'm getting ridiculously frustrated with my lack of creativity recently. It's fairly annoying, but I tried earlier today. I failed. <internal>(somewhat)</internal></p>
        <p>So, as I've told you, I now have a to-do list, which is really odd for someone my age, I'll probably find, but that's because I am <internal>(to some degree)</internal> very passionate about working on projects. If you are to look below, there is my to-do list, in a picture:</p>

            <figcaption>my to-do list</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I'll go through them one by one, since they would be enough to tell you of a lot of what I do.</p>
        <div id="todolist">
            <div id="mylifeorganized">
                <h2><i class="material-icons">&#xE835;</i> Activate MyLifeOrganized Pro.</h2>
                <p>Okay, so, MyLifeOrganized is the desktop thing I use to make to-do lists, organize projects, place in dreams and whatnot. I use a modified Get Things Done&trade; system. Yes, that is trademarked. It's a system technically owned by a guy who wrote a book on it named David Allen. Now, David Allen is a businessman, so he works with a lot of restrictions in location and work because a lot of business transactions and meetings, you can't do just...<em>anywhere</em>, so most of the concepts in his book, Getting Things Done, is written with the context being "most things can't be done everywhere". Now, the thing is, in our modern world, where we have phones in our pockets with a ridiculous amount of power <internal>(such as having access to the world's largest collection of human knowledge at a whim)</internal>, this book is <em><b>extremely</b></em> outdated. It's almost absurd how impractical it is now, since a hell lot of work can be done and finished with a phone, especially on large-screen phones such as mine.</p>
                <p>This dates the book, but the concepts are fairly simple to grasp. I've gotten the concepts without trudging through the, <internal>what most people would consider to be,</internal> single most painfully boring, useful book ever written <internal>(this is due to the supposedly absurd amount of business language and jargon used in the book)</internal>. That's because the system, in general is quite easy to grasp. C.G.P. Grey sums it up quite nicely in <a href="#hellointernet">Hello Internet</a>, during Episode 39, but I'll put it down here, for ease of access:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Capture</strong> everything.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process</strong> what can be done with it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Organize</strong> it all and sort into what can be done and not.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reflect</strong> on what needs to be done.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do it.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's surprising how well it works, but the problem part is the @context system, where things are given "contexts" <internal>(formatted:&nbsp;@&lt;<em>location/person/object</em>&gt;)</internal>. This can potentially be a very useful thing, but it is driven by accessibility to work, which, as previously stated, can be very easy to access almost anywhere, rendering the entire thing practically useless.</p>
                <p>My modifications to the system include the removal and/or reuse of the context system for other things, such as what that particular item on the list is for. I have also made an unintentional modification, mainly due to inaccessibility and lack of funds for it. I have been, fairly recently, saving up a lot of money for various purposes <internal>(some of which, you'll find in the to-do list itself)</internal>.</p>

                <p>If you're reading this, then that means this object has been marked off! Very lately, might I add. I haven't been very motivated to write this <internal>(if anything at all)</internal> recently. I haven't even been writing for <a href="#lacrimis">Lacrimis</a>, my personal writing project. It's been stuck at about 21.7k words for a while now. I don't know how to continue on with it, since I've been generally uninspired.</p>
                <h3 id="lacrimis"><i class="material-icons">&#xE150;</i> Lacrimis</h3>
                <p><strong>Lacrimis</strong> is a writing project, where I write stories of 500 words and up. I've had it for a while and I haven't really told you, because, well, it does have swears and can cover really odd subject areas of writing, but I've resolved that, eh, I'm sure you'd give me the artistic writer's license for that. It's just... writing about politically-correct and "clean" words all the time is incredibly boring. So, go ahead and <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/33182698-lacrimis">read the 30 parts of it</a>. I update sometimes. I have other writings on <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/user/KyniePaperack">that Wattpad account</a> as well.</p>
                <p><internal>Kynie Paperack is my pen name/pseudonym that I use for my writing. I do have accounts for a lot of things under that name including a Twitter account and a Wattpad account. I find myself making accounts for him by default.</internal></p>

            <div id="hellointernet">
                <h2><i class="material-icons">&#xE835;</i> Listen to Hello Internet all the way through.</h2>
                <p>I'm not sure if I've mentioned Hello Internet before, but <a href="https://hellointernet.fm/">Hello Internet</a> is a podcast made by CGP Grey (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey">YouTube&nbsp;channel</a>) and Brady Haran (<a href="http://www.bradyharanblog.com/projects/">list of YouTube channels and projects</a>). It's basically part of the, what they call the "two dudes talking" genre, which is a <em>hilariously</em> fitting name for the genre of their podcasts, since they have such an incredibly varied and unusual set of things they talk about from <a href="https://hellointernet.fm/podcast/26">having dinner with Darth Vader</a> to the <a href="http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/32">hilariously bad incompetence of YouTube with their new platforms and tools for creators like them</a> to the <a href="http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/39">aforementioned Getting Things Done system</a>. They vary quite a lot and are very interactive with their listeners. They also, quite famously, coined the new usage of the term <a href="http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/5">"free-booting"</a>, which is the stealing of content that someone else has created and placing it somewhere else without permission from the creator or attribution to them.</p>
                <p>I've been on a quest to listen to all 61 <internal>(+ some more, because extra snippets)</internal> of the episodes. So far, I'm up to Episode #42. Not done with that one yet, but that one's seeming interesting so far. The entire podcast in general is a very lax undertaking for them, since they both are educational YouTubers, which demand extra-high reliability and production value to be worth, what people may consider to be, worth watching, so the podcast, in comparison is very lax, thus the "two dudes talking"-genre podcast.</p>

                <p>I think I've covered these in a previous conversation. For a time, while Mi was out, I had to take over these two functions temporarily. However, in addition to managing this money, I've been managing my own, keeping track of my costs and trying to make sure I don't overspend. It's not really something that practically works, in a sense, for "budgeting", per se, but it's more to trick me into spending less so I can see a bigger number by the bottom of the sheet. Humans like big numbers, right? That's why it works, thus leaving me with better spending habits and a lot more saved.</p>

                <h2><i class="material-icons">&#xE835;</i> Operation: Arrange Everything</h2>
                <p>This is one of the most practical, actionable, and clerical piece of work there is in this entire list. It is just me arranging everything and pushing files around on my computer into boxes and sorting everything. I'm almost done with this, but, honestly, this is also the most relaxing thing on the list. This task is so mundane and virtually mindless that I've used it to escape the noisy confusion of life. During such, I just listen to whatever songs and I pay as little mind as I can to everything else, so I can just relax. I also like calling it "housekeeping", because, in a sense, my devices are a "home", where a lot of things and data I need are stored. The brain, to be perfectly honest, is a very bad and unreliable storage device, which is why we delegate so many functions to computers, thus making them a "home" to extra, more reliable storage, thus "housekeeping". I will be doing a proper housekeeping task, however, when I get my own room, since I don't have one currently.</p>

                <p>The only thing under this is Lacrimis, currently, but once I start world-building Havanelle, and start world-building with Jaypee, I think I'll add more under here. In addition, I think I'll also add a few other stories here, if I feel I should finally give them a decent update schedule <internal>(which is super unlikely, since I'm very bad at deadlines for writing)</internal>.</p>
                <p>As mentioned a bit earlier, I have quite a few stories under my Kynie Wattpad account, which includes the following:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Lacrimis</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>This is my main personal writing project. It is a very fragmented piece of work and much of it is left on a cliffhanger, so many may hate that fact, especially since I am often left terribly drained by one and I can't be bothered to finish or continue them. Whatever I deem enough for my abilities to continue get split off into a different story.</p>
                        <p>Lacrimis is very... mm, how should I put it? It's fairly unstable in its update schedule. I'll never really know when I'll feel like giving it some love.</p>
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>poem&eacute;</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>This one is fairly simple to understand. It is a compilation of poems about various things. Usually, it can end up being a reflection of how I'm feeling just then. It also has ridiculously sporadic updates and, sometimes, I'll even update twice in a day. Everything is in small caps. Even the title.</p>
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Warmth</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>Okay, this is a really odd one. This is fairly old, actually, dating back to 2013. This is technically reality fiction of I and Alexis. Go figure. It's not really in my writing style anymore, so it's fairly off-the-mark compared to the rest of the material. It's been discontinued officially in December 2015, but sometimes, I'll update it for no real reason, other than, "hah, I'll go write some just to troll."</p>
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Cryptic Constructions</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>This is a mystery thing. It's really odd right now. I've been meaning to rewrite this one, since it was way too rushed and crams in too much in too short a time. I could probably feasibly stretch the same thing across three chapters, just because <em>so much happens</em>. Might see a rewrite some time in May.</p>
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>To The Moon Storybook</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>I played a very well-written story in a game called "To The Moon". I believe I've mentioned it to you once, but basically, it's the type of game where you kind of have to lie down after you finish it because you have to process what the hell you had just witnessed <em>while crying</em>. Well, of course, I actually didn't cry, but it left me speechless for quite a while. <internal>(it seems I am very incapable of crying, usually. This is especially the case when I am extremely stressed. I feel like crying but I <em>never quite</em> get there.)</internal></p>
                        <p>Anyway, I essentially took the story of the game and put it down as a rewrite because I think it would fit better in the written works, but the game is indeed very good. It just has a slightly higher barrier of entry as a work, since most people are very reluctant to play a game, but I'm sure many of people would appreciate this work of art, since it has rendered many LPers crying, during the ending.</p>
                        <p>I am quite sure I'll update it at some point. I just don't know exactly when, considering how odd it is to write, since I have a very extensive reference. I'm basically a painter of atmosphere, but I do tweak some of the awkward dialogue...</p>
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Alive</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>This one is a story about the creation of a sentient Artificial Superintelligence. So far, I don't really know what direction I'll shoot this one off in, but considering what a massive subject Artificial Intelligence is and how unsure we are of how it will go, this story has an incredible amount of potential.</p>
                        <p>I just need to be unlazy enough to use it properly. Unknown update schedule. I'm very impulsive with these update schedules to be honest. HAHAHAHAHAHA</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>This is a story that takes place in an alternate universe where people's hearts are mechanical and they degrade and remain functional based on the kindness of the heart of the person in question. This one is very fun, since it's very, err, steampunk-ish, dare I say? That's essentially its genre: "steampunk slice of life".</p>

                <h2><i class="material-icons">&#xE835;</i> World-build with Jaypee.</h2>
                <p>Havanelle is a fictional universe I've been meaning to create for quite some time now. I haven't done any proper world-building with it yet, but I do plan to at some point. It's fairly tentative, but I think most of the world-building will be established by first writing a story for it, then rending all the plotholes, gradually making the world more and more cohesive.</p>
                <p>I originally planned to do this with Jirah, but for many, many reasons I am unwilling to go into, I will instead go through with it alone. This will probably expand the feasible creation timeline quite a fair bit, but, yeah, I'm pretty sure I'll be doing this one.</p>
                <p>Jaypee and I, on the other hand, have planned to worldbuild at some point. We're not sure when yet, but it will be whenever time allows. I'm sure the lore will be quite interesting, since we're both scientifically-inclined. Perhaps, we'll even work out the physics of it, if we're both unlazy enough to go that deep.</p>

            <div id="camera">
                <h2><i class="material-icons">&#xE834;</i> Import photos from camera.</h2>
                <p>So, basically, I move stuff off the camera's SD card, sort them, assigning tags, and putting them into storage. Currently, I have approximately 674 assorted image and video files on my laptop which were taken from the camera. I had to go through each and every one of them to tag and sort them, accordingly. It was extremely time-consuming, but the indexing works in such a way that I can search "floorshots" and it will pull up all the photos and videos which are floor shots. Very useful, especially with the large number of them.</p>
                <p>Housekeeping and arranging digital files, as I said, is extremely relaxing, since one can even work on this with little to no thought.</p>

                <p>Admittedly, recently, I haven't been reading much, mainly because, recently, a lot of my books have been in boxes and other storage things while the library is being, well, built, but even before that, I haven't been reading much. The last book I read was about partway through the fourth ASoUE book. Yes, I have been meaning to continue it, but I have been well, fairly caught up in creating things, rather than consuming things. I'm not sure why, but I guess it's just a thing I have had recently. I'm sure I'll get back to books at some point. I always do.</p>

                <p>I illustrate a lot. Have I ever told you that? I say that because, across three years, I have managed to make approximately 66 various icons, wallpapers, Twitter headers, avatars, movie posters, conceptual works, etc. I'm bloody proud to have 560mB worth of my work. I've even done some work for the school. <em>As in the institution that I go to learn. <strong>I technically worked for them, very briefly.</strong></em> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Of course, they can't exactly pay me, though. That was good fun. Here's some of my work:</p>

                <p>This item is just because the pen on my Note's stylus is, well, rather iffy. It wears over time, so it's normal. I just need to find my pack of the tips in my desk. I'll have to sort through a lot of that, so I think this will fall under "housekeeping (in real life)", when I get my room done. I have a lot of things so... yep.</p>
                <p>Speaking of my phone, I have, somehow, managed to make my phone a fairly complex piece of thing in my workflow. It's not necessary, but it makes things greatly more bearable. It's very versatile and can be fairly useful, especially when use of a more-capable device is limited (i.e., laptop). The cloud makes it a very versatile companion, especially with remote connection to my laptop.</p>

                <p>Okay, remember how I said housekeeping on my files is ridiculously mundane and clerical to the point of being nearly mindless? Well, apparently, with the replacement of Batch (cmd), I can automate about 80% of the work, once I learn Powershell. I think I can do it this summer, but, then again, Powershell has some very odd properties as a scripting language, compared to what I've used so far, so it is kind of unfamiliar territory here.</p>

            <div id="webapps">
                <h2><i class="material-icons">&#xE835;</i> Learn how to make webapps.</h2>
                <p>This is a fairly old one. I have been meaning to do this for a while, but it basically breaks down to me learning four things: Javascript, node.js, electron, and git. The first and the second will be the primary thing that carries all of the functions and the actual thing in question, while the third is a secondary framework, which connects the web app (written in JS, HTML, and CSS) to the local filesystem (the one the computer accesses for files and whatnot). THe fourth is a Version Control System which is used to keep track of changes in things such as bug fixes and building features on different branches to make it more simple to have versionings of the file, without massively consuming system resources. It's going to be very useful, once I learn that. Maybe, at some point, I can write my own version of MLO and have all the features I want and need.</p>
                <p>Programming is a beautiful art indeed, and it's the one thing that separates people who "make" and "make do".</p>

                <h2 class="nb"><i class="material-icons">&#xE835;</i> Buy a Raspberry Pi.</h2>
                <p>These are all purchases with no specific "by" date. A common trait is that they are all creative ventures with such ridiculous amount of potential, I'll have a hard time deciding which use I exactly want to get them for. For example, that 5d set is a very good random number generator and could be useful, if I decide I want to formulate a board game which require those dice. I could also play Dungeons and Dragons with it, which is a very appealing thing to think about to me. A mechanical keyboard (with macro capabilities) can make a lot of my workflow for things much faster, lettimg me do more with less time. It would be especially useful when video editing and illustrating, so I can assign shortcuts to buttons for cutting footage or rotating this by 90&deg; or that by a smidgen over 47.6&deg;.</p>
                <p>The Raspberry Pi, however, has the most potential. It is literally just a cheap, open circuit board, that's small and programmable. I could do pretty much anything with this, as long as I tried hard enough. I could make a doorbell. I could make a sound driver, and hook up speakers everywhere in the house. I could case it with several hard drives and have a local server in the house. It's very versatile and extremely cheap for what it can do.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, shipping in the Philippines in the largest pain in the ass one could ever ask for, especially something as niche as an open circuit board.</p>

        <p>And that is my extremely long explanation for my to-do list. Hopefully, I've shed some light on what exactly it is I do. There's a lot isn't there?</p>
        
        <p>Recently, I've been passing through a lot of the stuff I've went through back then. I guess it's a side effect of having an absurdly massive amount of time dedicated to sort and look through old files. I found myself watching old videos from the LPers I used to watch from such as Chuggaaconroy and listening to the OST of various older games I used to play a lot. Super Paper Mario's Original SoundTrack is surprisingly sprinkled with leitmotifs, which I never noticed.</p>
        <p>Hm... am I missing anything...? I don't think so.</p>
